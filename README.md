# DeGoogYourself
Delete Google from your life


how to degoog your life as much as possible

How did *you* end up here?

I came here in the aftermath of the 2016 US Presidential election, when I deleted my social media accounts.  All but one proved fairly simple.

Google.

Not through any dark patterns or for lack of customer service, rather, Google is *so* convenient it is nearly impossible to give up.

However, I've mostly migrated away.

I understand that I don't control the radio/modem and so, obviously, NSA has already pwned me.  Yeah. I know.  I'd just rather keep it to them.

By far the most difficult services (for me) to ditch have been Google Play Services, Google Maps, and Google Photos.

Google Play services is built into Android in a way that makes it *very* difficult to do without, despite not being part of the core OS.

Google Maps is so reliable, in such a profound way, it has put its competitors out of business one by one.  There is Apple maps, if you care for that flavor, but offline, in-dash navigation from the likes of TomTom and Garmin are completely gone.  This cannot be blamed on COVID; the most recent head unit with an offline navigation function was a 2014 Sony SKU.

Google Photos is peerless.  I can browse my entire photo library on a phone I've just logged into without having to cache the entire library first.  I dunno how they do it.  Unbelievably local CDN's I imagine.  No other solution I've tried has come close to Google Photo's ability to offer frictionless backup, and seamless galleries. Ditching this app has put, not a dent, but a near stop on my pocketcam photo output.  I don't take pictures any more in the same way, because I know it will be difficult to back them up, browse them, and share them.

In the secondary tier are GMail, Google Contacts, Google Calendar, Google Drive, YouTube, and Translate.

I've been on a quest now for 7 years to rid myself of this dependency.

Here is my story:

Get a cell phone that has official support from LineageOS

Devices from Google (ironically), Sony, Samsung, Oneplus, and Motorola are decent bets but check https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/ first.

Ideally, try the oldest initial version first, since it is usually the most stable.

I chose a OnePlus Nord N200.  I'm currently a version behind (19.1), since, although considered "stable", the current build (20.0) has problems with BlueTooth, phone calls, and reading from the sd card. It's a good idea to wait for that ".1" if you care about actually being able to use your phone vs. just-testing-things-out.

If you're coming from a device that you're currently daily driving, here are some good things to backup.

Before you backup, disable Wifi and remove the simcard to avoid overlapping sync issues!

**remove sim!**

Backup sms, mms, call log, 2FA, OPML, and NewPipe.

Refresh login to nextcloud and bitwarden on separate machine for backup purposes
